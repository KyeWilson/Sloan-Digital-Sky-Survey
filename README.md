# Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Galaxy Zoo Neural Network Analysis

This project explores the Galaxy Zoo dataset using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to investigate how different models and configurations classify celestial objects (Galaxy, Star, or Quasar).

The analysis addresses three key questions:
1. **Q1**: How well can a Decision Tree classify celestial objects?
2. **Q2**: How does a Neural Network compare to a Decision Tree for this task?
3. **Q3**: How does the choice of activation function affect Neural Network performance?

The project is designed to guide users through:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalising, and encoding features.
2. **Model Design**: Building and training machine learning and neural network models.
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and generalisation.

## Dataset
### Source
The dataset originates from the Galaxy Zoo Challenge, a citizen science project aimed at classifying galaxies based on their visual properties. It provides valuable insights into celestial objects, aiding research in astronomy and machine learning.

### Features
- **Input Features**: RA, DEC, magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z), and redshift.
- **Target Labels**: Object classification (Galaxy, Star, or Quasar).

## Why This Dataset?
The Galaxy Zoo dataset is ideal for machine learning tasks due to:

1. **Complexity**: The dataset includes highly varied and non-linear relationships, making it a good testbed for advanced classification models.

2. **Real-World Application**: Understanding celestial objects aids in astronomical research and supports projects like identifying high-redshift galaxies.

3. **Large Sample Size**: Ensures meaningful results and reliable model evaluation.

## Project Structure
### Q1: Decision Tree Classifier
#### Objective: Classify celestial objects using a Decision Tree Classifier.

**Highlights**:
  - Preprocessed dataset to handle missing values and feature scaling.
  - Achieved 99% accuracy, demonstrating its simplicity and effectiveness.
  - High precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes.

### Q2: Neural Network Classifier
#### Objective: Build a Neural Network and compare its performance to the Decision Tree.

**Highlights**:
  - Used two hidden layers with ReLU activation and softmax output.
  - Achieved 98% accuracy, with notable improvements in Quasar classification.

### Q3: Effect of Activation Functions
#### Objective: Examine the impact of different activation functions on Neural Network performance.

**Highlights**:
  - Investigated **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, and **Tanh** activations.
  - **ReLU** and **Tanh** both achieved 99% accuracy, with **Tanh** reducing loss more effectively.
  - **Sigmoid** underperformed with 97% accuracy and slower convergence.
